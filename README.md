# Further Attacks on the Micali-Schnorr Pseudorandom Generator
The Micali-Schnorr pseudorandom number generator has been in use since its inception in 1990. However, serious concerns about the possibility of a backdoor were raised in 2023 since its security is not tightly coupled to that of the RSA problem. Our work begins by uncovering a new range of vulnerable parameter choices. We also demonstrate the existence of vulnerable exponents and develop a framework to detect the possibility of a backdoors for vulnerable exponents based on public parameters.

This repository contains an implementation of the Bad-e, Small State, Improved Small State Attacks for the Micali-Schnorr pseudorandom generator as outlined in our paper. For further instructions, please see the respective folders.
